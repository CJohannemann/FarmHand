# Applies FarmHand's schema (schema.sql, seed.sql, then every migration in
# order) to the self-hosted Postgres. For a BRAND-NEW database only, once,
# after `docker compose up -d db auth` — this depends on GoTrue having
# already bootstrapped the auth schema and auth.uid(), which schema.sql's
# row-level security references. See README.md for the full order of
# operations.
#
# Re-running this against a database that already has it fails outright:
# schema.sql is bare `create table`, not `create table if not exists`, and
# seed.sql has no guard against inserting its rows a second time. Added a
# migration since and want it on an existing install? That's
# apply-migrations.sh instead — every migration file, unlike these two, is
# written to be safe to run again.
#
# Runs psql *inside* the db container rather than requiring it installed on
# the host — one less thing to apt install on a space-conscious VPS.
#
